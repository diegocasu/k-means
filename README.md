# Overview

This repository contains the Hadoop and Spark implementation of the _k_-means algorithm.

The repository is organized in the following way:
- _hadoop_ contains the Hadoop code
- _spark_ contains the Spark code
- _points_gen_ contains a script for generating dataset of points
- _plotter_ contains a script for visualizing the results useful for validating the implementations
- _test_ contains a script to launch batch performance tests on both the implementations

## Requirements

The requirements are needed for executing both the spark code and the utility scripts.

They can be installed by:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
